# Subagent Progress — multi-tenancy-foundation

Coordinator recovery checkpoint. Does not replace plan/OpenSpec checkboxes.

- build_mode: subagent-driven-development
- tdd_mode: tdd
- isolation: branch (feature/20260704/multi-tenancy-foundation)
- plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-04-multi-tenancy-foundation.md
- total plan tasks: 14

## ENV NOTE (all dispatches)
bun v1.3.14 is installed at `/c/Users/rahma/.bun/bin/bun.exe` but NOT on the bash PATH.
Every dispatch prompt must instruct the agent to prepend it:
`export PATH="/c/Users/rahma/.bun/bin:$PATH"` before any bun/bunx command.
Do NOT use the PowerShell tool — its shim needs dotnet, which is absent (exit 82). Use bash only.

## ZOD NOTE (all zod-under-vitest tasks: db, api specs)
In files RUN under vitest, import zod as a namespace: `import * as z from "zod"`.
Named `import { z } from "zod"` → `z.object` undefined at runtime under the vitest
transform (both unplugin-swc AND vitest4 Oxc). Verified empirically. Do not "clean up"
namespace zod imports to named form. See memory zod-namespace-import-under-vitest.

## Plan→OpenSpec checkoff map
- T1 → 1.1 ✔ | T2 → 1.2 ✔ | T3 → (sub-step of 1.3, no checkoff) | T4 → 1.3 + 1.4
- T6 → 2.3 | T9 → 2.2 | T11 → 2.1
- T8 → 3.1 | T10 → 3.2 | T13 → 3.3
- T12 → 4.1, 4.2 | T14 → 4.3, 4.4

## Current task
- task: Task 8 — Public host → tenant resolution middleware (REAL TDD)
- plan-task-text: "## Task 8: Public host → tenant resolution"
- openspec-task-text: "3.1 Public host → tenant resolver (apex/localhost → default tenant; unknown subdomain → 404)" (checkoff after this task)
- stage: implementing
- base: (HEAD after Task 7 closeout — set at dispatch)
- impl-commit: (pending)
- gate: TDD — spec tests pure slugFromHost (6 cases: apex→default, localhost(:port)→default, sub.host→slug, {slug}.localhost→slug, www→default, undefined→default). RED→GREEN(6). Middleware: no auth header → resolve host tenant into CLS or 404 on unknown; auth header → leave for JwtStrategy. Fastify raw req headers. typecheck: no new errors beyond baseline.
- reviews-passed: none
- review-fix-round: 0

## apps/api typecheck BASELINE (known cross-task breakage from Task 1's AuthUser/User shape change)
As of HEAD after Task 4, `cd apps/api && bunx tsc --noEmit` has 9 known errors, all "Property 'tenantId'/'isPlatformOwner' is missing", in:
- auth.service.ts (×2), jwt.strategy.ts → fixed by Task 10
- auth.service.spec.ts → fixed by Task 10
- users.service.ts, users.service.int.spec.ts → fixed by Task 11
- roles.guard.spec.ts, users.policy.spec.ts (×2) → ORPHANED (no task owns these specs' mocks). PLAN GAP: fold into Task 10/11 scope or fix at Task 14 verify. Add tenantId/isPlatformOwner to their AuthUser/User mocks.
For apps/api tasks 5-9: the verification gate is "MY changed files are error-free AND no NEW error beyond this baseline set" — NOT a clean package typecheck (impossible until T10/T11).

## Minor findings (defer to final whole-branch review triage)
- T6: `tenant-scoped-db.ts:~79` `and(tenantPredicate, extra) as SQL` — add a source comment (not just report) explaining the cast is safe because and() has ≥1 condition here; a future zero-arg refactor wouldn't be compiler-caught.
- T6: `insertValues`/`update` take `Record<string, unknown>` — widest trust boundary (mistyped columns slip through `as never`). Brief allows it; final review may tighten.
- T3: `packages/db/src/schema/users.ts:1` imports `boolean` from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` instead of the `./tenants` re-export Task 2 added for this consumer. Functionally identical; matches the brief's (internally inconsistent) example. Consequence: the `boolean` re-export in `schema/tenants.ts:~30` is currently unused. Final review: either route users.ts import through ./tenants, or drop the unused re-export.

## Completed tasks
- Task 1 — shared tenant contracts (974baa1..3885865; 1 fix round: tsconfig gate + zod namespace import)
- Task 2 — tenants table + tenantOwned() (e99c451; clean)
- Task 3 — users tenant-owned (c6c3206; scope-creep seed.ts reverted; clean after)
